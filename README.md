i Made a Smite speed hack cause im not gonna pay $30 for a week key from these clownes in the community. you must inject a dll into smite i used a free one i found on here. then you open the trainer. The dll talks to the trainer when you make adjustments to the speed.You must have use d11 off in smite settings. sometimes the game crashed when you adjust the speed too much i recommend setting it to one speed and leaving it there. There is no activate button its always on i preferred this because i use controller. Speed multiplier limited to 2.0 because you often crash when you start going higher than that. ill try to link the spoofer i usd if i can figure it out as this is my first post. ive just been raging with it i keep my setting on 1.47 but you could defiantly turn this to like 1.04 and fly under the radar.
